#### This project is based on TensorFlow and Kubernetes, it is part of my graduation project.


#### This project mainly includes three parts. All this parts are about improvment of k8s scheduling mechanism for distributed deep learning workloads on TensorFlow.
#### Kubernetes version is 1.2.0 and TensorFlow version is 0.9.0. This project's distributed deep learning code used TensorFLow's between-graph mode. 

Part 1. DLTAP method.

Deep Learning Task Allocation Priority:

Part 2. DLMAP method.

Deep Learning Mix Allocation Priority:

Part 3. ARST method.

Adaptive Random Sampling Strategy:
